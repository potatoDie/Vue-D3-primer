# Vue-D3-primer

This is an experiment to test the combination of Vue and D3.js.

I remember having difficulties in having them work together, but now I think that had to do with d3.drag (and Vue and d3 were fighting over the data).

In this case Vue takes the lead (is the single source of truth) and handles data and UI. D3 merely visualizes the data (graphically).
